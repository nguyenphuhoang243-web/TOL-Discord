## 🛠️ Development & Contributing

Want to contribute or run this locally?

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/merenut/RediculousCoding
cd RediculousCoding

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the native audio helper for your current platform
npm run build:audio-helper

# Compile TypeScript
npm run compile

# Open in VS Code and press F5 to launch Extension Development Host
code .
```

Native/helper audio is intended for local desktop VS Code sessions only.

### Helper Targets
- `npm run build:audio-helper` builds the helper for the current host platform.
- `npm run build:audio-helper:win32-x64`, `npm run build:audio-helper:linux-x64`, and `npm run build:audio-helper:darwin-x64` are the primary target scripts for packaging on native CI runners.
- ARM64 targets are wired into the build script as `win32-arm64`, `linux-arm64`, and `darwin-arm64`, but they still require matching toolchains and runner support before they should be considered release-ready.

### Architecture
- **Extension Host** (`src/extension.ts`) - Main extension logic
- **XP Service** (`src/xp/XPService.ts`) - Handles leveling and progression
- **Effect Manager** (`src/effects/EffectManager.ts`) - Visual effects and animations
- **Panel Provider** (`src/view/PanelViewProvider.ts`) - Webview control panel
- **Audio Service** (`src/audio/`) - Host-side audio backend selection and native-helper integration
- **Webview** (`webview/`) - HTML/CSS/JS for the settings panel

## 🎊 Credits & Inspiration

This VS Code extension lovingly recreates and expands upon the original concept:

- **Original Godot Plugin** - "ridiculous_coding" by [John Watson](https://github.com/jotson/ridiculous_coding)
- **Game Inspiration** - [Textreme2](https://ash-k.itch.io/textreme-2) by Ash K
- **VS Code Adaptation** - Enhanced with modern web technologies and VS Code integration

## 📝 Technical Notes

- **Performance Optimized** - Effects are rate-limited and memory-managed
- **Multi-Editor Support** - Works independently across multiple open editors  
- **Hybrid Audio Rollout** - Native/helper audio targets local desktop sessions, with webview audio as fallback
- **Cross-Platform** - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **VS Code API** - Uses official VS Code decoration and webview APIs
